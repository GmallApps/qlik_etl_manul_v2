This is scheduled to automatically run at exactly 12:00 AM daily. The ETL App then loads the generated JSON files into the DTWHS . Qlik then extracts the data again from the DTWHS . Qlik then collates all the data from the DTWHS then saves it as raw QVD files here: \\\\10.10.175.101\\Qlik DSG\\Raw Data for later use. Qlik then gets the data from the raw QVD files, saves it into memory. Qlik runs a predefined script to transform the raw data, then saves it again as transformed QVD files, here: \\\\10.10.175.101\\Qlik DSG\\Transformed Data . Qlik then gets the data from the transformed QVD files, saves it into memory then serves it to the users. Users then gets to view the data by visiting the Hub: http://10.10.0.91/hub . NOTE The whole process consumes around 11 hours of time. Starting from 12:00 AM and ending at approximately 2:30 PM. During this period, user will only be able to see yesterday's data when opening the Hub. Any changes made with Qlik script or reloading/rerun of inconsistent data will be reflected tomorrow around 2:30 PM. You can check reloading status by visiting: http://10.10.0.91/qmc/tasks Daily Checking Daily checking makes sure the data between the DTWHS & MMS are consistent. This is to be done daily and should start first thing in the morning. To check, please follow the steps below: RDP to 10.10.175.101 and login as Administrator the run the ETL Verifier Script on the desktop. The script will create 16 csv files (8 from MMS and 8 from ETL DTWHS) files as results, after approximately 4 hours . You can view the results under the folder with the current date in YYYYMMDD format. For example, if today is December 01, 2021, the csv files will saved in the 20211201 folder. Extract all the data and compare the amount of each date like in the image below, make sure the dates are aligned: Add any inconsistent date to the rerun queue in the ETL app using the SHU utility. When finished, navigate to Daily Loading and update the ETL app date to the yesterday and click Save . Open your web browser and check the QMC tasks http://10.10.0.91/qmc/tasks . Make sure that tasks 2.0Extract_Transaction status is Success , before click Start on the ETL app. NOTE: Any changes or data update during the actions during the Daily Checking will be reflected the next day after QMC tasks are completed. Daily Customer Load Customer loading in the ETL is separate as it will interfere with the other ETL jobs. This is to be done daily first thing in the morning. Open ETL app then navigate to Jobs . Uncheck everything in 'Active' column and leave the customer job checked. Navigate to Daily Loading and update the ETL app date to the yesterday and click Save . Click Start and wait for the ---===(ETL FINISH)===--- status. Navigate to Jobs again and reverse your action in step number 2 leaving only customer unchecked ETL Common Issues, Solutions, & Procedures Cannot connect to DTWHS or RDP to 10.10.175.101 . Make sure you're connected to the network. Ping 10.10.175.101 and make sure that you receive a reply, otherwise contact ICT support. SHU is not showing all retail process even though jobs are active. Exit and relaunch the ETL App Error in ETL App logs Log errors can't always be predicted. However, you can safely ignore Transport connection errors in PaymentDistribution because the database connection is local in the ETL App context. You may also ignore Duplicate Primary Key errors in the sku . These are non-fatal errors and the ETL can still function with it. Most common fatal error is when either or both MMS and WinDSS servers are offline. Make sure to map the WinDSS shared folder \\\\10.10.0.45\\ETL-update as drive X and also make sure that shared folder have all these files: CUST.TPS , vCUSTCARD.TPS , and vCUSTTRANc.TPS , otherwise contact system admin. ETL did not finish If you can't see any ---===(ETL FINISH)===--- status on the ETL app. Check the logs because the ETL app may have encountered a fatal error. How to do DTWHS database backup RDP to 10.10.175.101 and run XAMPP Control Panel . Click shell then paste this command: mysqldump -u root dsg_datawarehouse | gzip > E:\\mysql\\dumps\\dsg_datawarehouse_YYMMDD.sql.gz replacing YYMMDD with the date today. This will generate a compressed .sql file at E:\\mysql\\dumps . Please note that due to the size of the DTWHS, this will take a significant amount of time! Restore DTWHS backup To restore the whole database, uncompress the .sql.gz file using WinRAR first. This will a take a long time, be patient! After that run XAMPP Control Panel . Click shell then paste this command: mysql -u root dsg_datawarehouse < D:\\dumps\\dsg_datawarehouse_YYMMDD.sql replacing YYMMDD with the date of the backup.

Qlik or QlikSense is a Business Intelligence System for which business can easily get a KPI report for analysis and identification of key factors. DSG's use of Qlik constitutes the sales & performance of the company. How to access Qlik? There are actually 3-ways to access Qlik. Via Web Browser: QMC: http://10.10.0.91/qmc/ - use this link to manage Qlik settings. Hub: http://10.10.0.91/hub/ - use this link to view/manage Qlik KPI. Via VNC: IP Address: 10.10.0.91 - This will enable you to manage the Main Qlik Server Daily Checking Part of your tasks as the Application Administrator is to check the consistency of data between MMS, ETL Server, and Qlik. To do this, follow the steps below: Open hub in web browser http://10.10.0.91/hub/ , login with your assigned credentials then navigate to the Retail stream. Find Sales Performance (Department View) , choose a date and check for the total. Open the Receipt worksheet from your ETL Daily Checking and crosscheck the total for that date and confirm if it matches with Qlik. If not, add that date to the ETL rerun queue. Updating Section Access There are instance in which you need to change the section access of the users. To do this, follow the steps below: Open hub in web browser http://10.10.0.91/hub/ , login with your assigned credentials then navigate to the Retail stream. Duplicate the GRID DSG 1.0_Retail app. Wait the confirmation, this will take a few minutes. Navigate to Work and open the duplicate. Usually denoted by (n) where n is a digit. While in the app, click the compass icon in the upper left side on the app, this will open a context menu and select Data Load Editor . Navigate to Section Access and update the script as needed. For help on the script, visit official Qlik documentation here! After editing the script, save the app and on the hub and under work section, look for the app that you've edited and republish it by replacing the app on the retail stream. NOTE: Any changes or update with section access will be reflected the next day after QMC tasks are completed. Qlik Common Issues, Solutions, & Procedures Cannot connect to 10.10.0.91 . Make sure you're connected to the network. Ping 10.10.0.91 and make sure that you receive a reply, otherwise contact ICT support. Data Missing / Not Found Errors Make sure the data has done loading. Check by looking at QMC tasks if all are success status and/or opening any KPI and looking at the Last Loaded in the upper-right, make sure it's today. If not, wait for the QMC tasks to finish. Note that not found errors are known to be notoriously hard to diagnose .Start by checking the data in the MMS database using a query, then check ETL DTWHS, and finally QVD files. Also note that QVD files are very large and some can't be opened on a typical manner. Please consult the Qlik Documentation as I haven't done this myself.
